# Vision Statement

Our nutrition solution is a web application designed to assist individuals with diet restrictions, whether stemming from medical, religious, or personal reasons. 

Upon initial login, the application constructs a user profile through a comprehensive questionnaire, facilitating personalized recommendations for recipes and then featuring them on the front page. 

Notably, an advanced search feature is available, allowing users to specify their constraints and preferences, encompassing allergies, intolerances, deficiencies, and limited intake parameters like sodium, carbs, and sugar. 

Additionally, users can filter and receive recommendations tailored to religion-based dietary restrictions, such as adherence to Halal and Kosher rules. 

The true strength of our application lies in its ability to harmonize dietary choices with individual medical needs. This topic is of high importance, considering the universal applicability of our solutionâ€”everyone needs to eat, and a health-conscious diet is a conduit to a thriving life for all. 

Unlike our competitors such as eatingwell.com and delish.com, our application excels in integrating diverse requirements through advanced search functionalities and personalized profiles. This results in precise dish recommendations tailored to users' distinct needs and desires.
