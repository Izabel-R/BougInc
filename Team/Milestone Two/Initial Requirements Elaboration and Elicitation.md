# Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Profile:**
   - Users should be able to create and manage a profile.
   - The profile should capture dietary restrictions for medical, religious, and personal reasons.
   - Preferences such as likes and dislikes should be stored in the user profile.

2. **Recipe Recommendations:**
   - The application should recommend recipes based on user preferences.
   - Recommendations should be prominently featured on the front page.
   - Preferences considered should include dietary restrictions, likes, and dislikes.

3. **Advanced Search Feature:**
   - Users should have the ability to perform advanced searches.
   - The search feature should allow users to specify dietary constraints (allergies, intolerances, deficiencies, etc.).
   - Constraints should also cover parameters like sodium, carbs, and sugar.

4. **Recipe Collections:**
   - Users should be able to add recipes to a collection tied to their profile.
   - The collection feature allows users to store recipes for future reference.

5. **Dietary Plan Creation:**
   - The application should provide a feature to create a dietary plan.
   - The plan should be based on selected recipes and include needed calories/nutrient intake.
   - Users should be able to follow the plan on a daily basis.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:**
   - The system should respond quickly to user interactions, providing a seamless experience.
   - Search results and recipe recommendations should be efficiently generated.

2. **Scalability:**
   - The application should be scalable to accommodate a growing user base.
   - Performance should not significantly degrade with an increase in the number of users.

3. **Security:**
   - User profiles and dietary information should be securely stored.
   - Access controls should ensure that users can only view and modify their own profiles.

4. **Usability:**
   - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
   - Accessibility considerations should be taken into account.

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to create and manage my profile, specifying dietary restrictions and preferences.**
   
2. **As a user, I want to receive recipe recommendations on the front page based on my dietary preferences and restrictions.**

3. **As a user, I want to perform advanced searches, specifying constraints like allergies, intolerances, and nutrient parameters.**

4. **As a user, I want to add recipes to a collection tied to my profile for future reference.**

5. **As a user, I want to create a dietary plan based on selected recipes and daily nutrient intake.**

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **User Profile:**
   - Users can successfully create, update, and delete their profiles.
   - Dietary restrictions and preferences are accurately captured in the profile.

2. **Recipe Recommendations:**
   - Recipe recommendations on the front page align with user preferences and restrictions.
   - Users can like or dislike recipes to influence future recommendations.

3. **Advanced Search Feature:**
   - Advanced search results accurately reflect specified constraints and preferences.
   - Nutrient parameters in the search are customizable and generate relevant results.

4. **Recipe Collections:**
   - Users can add and remove recipes from their collection.
   - The collection is accessible and manageable through the user profile.

5. **Dietary Plan Creation:**
   - Users can create a dietary plan based on selected recipes and daily nutrient needs.
   - The application provides a clear daily plan for users to follow.

## Dependencies

1. **Ingredient Database:**
   - The system relies on an extensive database of ingredients and their nutritional information.

2. **External APIs:**
   - For religious dietary restrictions, integration with external APIs providing information on Halal and Kosher ingredients.

3. **Machine Learning Model (Future):**
   - For the picture recognition feature, the development and integration of a machine learning model will be necessary.

## Assumptions and Constraints

1. **Data Accuracy:**
   - The accuracy of dietary information depends on the correctness of the ingredient database.

2. **User Input:**
   - The success of personalized features relies on users providing accurate dietary information and preferences.

3. **External API Reliability:**
   - The availability and reliability of external APIs for religious dietary information are assumed.

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Data Privacy Concerns:**
   - Risk: Users may have concerns about the privacy of their dietary information.
   - Mitigation: Implement robust data encryption and clearly communicate privacy measures to users.

2. **Integration Challenges with External APIs:**
   - Risk: Integration with external APIs for religious dietary information may pose challenges.
   - Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and have contingency plans in place.

3. **Scalability Issues:**
   - Risk: Rapid user growth may lead to scalability issues.
   - Mitigation: Regularly assess system performance and scale infrastructure accordingly.

This document serves as an initial outline for the requirements. Further refinement and detailing will be conducted during the development process, and feedback from stakeholders will be incorporated.
