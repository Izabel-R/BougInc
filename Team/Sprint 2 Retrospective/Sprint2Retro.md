Loved, Longed for, Loathed, Learned

Loved: Teamwork, getting things done, learning new things
Longed for: Greater communication, more committment, getting things done earlier
Loathed: Lack of communication, communication of user stories, not getting things done
Learned: That we need to enforce the already existing rules, we need to communicate more, we need to get things done earlier



Rules That Still Hold From Sprint 1

Mid-sprint deadline: Sunday
End-sprint deadline: Saturday

Have 3 points worth of effort done by Mid-sprint deadline

Use tasks to notify other team members of progress on user stories by mid-sprint deadline

Each person is responsible for their tasks and user story descriptions during the sprint backlog.



Sprint 2 Rules

I(Evgeny) won't accept pull requests the day of the meeting.

Each deadline (Mid or End deadline) will be called out and everyone will have to report what they have done by that deadline.
