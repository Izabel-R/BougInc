# Steam News Site Summary

## Visual Design

### Top Section
- Category navigation starting from the lefthand side, for the home page, top news, top games, and user feed sections
- Search bar on the right of navigation, allowing for direct navigation to game pages or news listings
- User login and dropdown menu, with sections for profile, settings, 
- Centered website logo or banner that indicates a distinct separation from Steam

### Body
- Homepage, with information and a prominent display section featuring a "territory war" style portion that shows the top 20 games visually
- Personalized page with sections displaying recent news from games that are in the same genre as the user's favorited games as well as new ones such as "Recommended for You" or "Games You Might Like"
- Top game page showing sections such as "New Releases" and "Top Played", with relevant news displayed based on selected game.
- Top news page showing sections like "Recent Events", "Industry News", and "New Releases".

### Bottom Navigation Bar
- Navigation to the site's about page, copyright information, and misc user information.

## Key Visual Design Considerations

### Color Palette
- A darker blue and cool pallete, meant to not visually stray far from Steam's iconic look.

### Font Choices
- Sharp and clean font choice, again mirroring Steam's display. Some variance and stylization can be used, though limited.

### Imagery
- Official promotional art, article thumbnails, and other free use applicable images.

### Whitespace
- Ample whitespace between elements to create a sense of visual clarity and prevent the app from feeling cluttered.

## Functionality

- The home page should have a dynamic visual that changes based on the player-count distribution of the top 20 games being played at any time.
- The search bar should allow users to easily find both specific game pages as well as specific news articles that fit the given keywords.
- The user profile and settings should allow a user to find and edit aspects of their account, like their favorited games.
- The top games section should feature new releases, games with high player count, and the ability for site operators to manually feature games.
- The personalization section should house a relevant list of recent news for user's favorited games, with sorting for their lists.
- All articles should have a visual indicator to denote if they have been read or not, allowing a user to know at a glance if a piece is new.
- The top news section should utilize an additional API, RSS feed, or assistance from an AI to curate recent relevant news that may or may not be directly linked to a specific game, such as announcements and events.
- The bottom navigation bar should house all information relevant to users looking to know more about the site, company, and their operations.

## Summary

This news site is meant to provide users with a more accessible way to get access to relevant updates, articles, and news than Steam's current UI provides. While meant to visually and stylistically fit with Steam cleanly, the site is designed to iterate and improve upon it. Users can add games to lists, marking them as relevant for the site's personalized feed, in addition to having allowance for reccomendations of games with similar genres or tags. The homepage's visualization of the top player-count games is built to catch the eye of new users and give an interesting and dynamic feel from the very first impression.
